# **Weather Forecast App**

This is **Project 2** from my web development course at **IT School**, showcasing the use of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build a fully functional weather forecasting application. The app integrates APIs to fetch and display weather data, allowing users to view the current weather and a 5-day forecast.
